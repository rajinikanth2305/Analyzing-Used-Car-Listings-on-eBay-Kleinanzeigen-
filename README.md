# Analyzing-Used-Car-Listings-on-eBay-Kleinanzeigen-
I will be working on a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a [classifieds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data). The version of the dataset we are working with is a sample of 50,000 data points that was prepared by Dataquest including simulating a less-cleaned version of the data.

The data dictionary provided with data is as follows:

dateCrawled - When this ad was first crawled. All field-values are taken from this date.<br>
name - Name of the car.<br>
seller - Whether the seller is private or a dealer.<br>
offerType - The type of listing<br>
price - The price on the ad to sell the car.<br>
abtest - Whether the listing is included in an A/B test.<br>
vehicleType - The vehicle Type.<br>
yearOfRegistration - The year in which which year the car was first registered.<br>
gearbox - The transmission type.<br>
powerPS - The power of the car in PS.<br>

monthOfRegistration - The month in which which year the car was first registered.<br>
fuelType - What type of fuel the car uses.<br>
brand - The brand of the car.<br>

nrOfPictures - The number of pictures in the ad.<br>
postalCode - The postal code for the location of the vehicle.<br>

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings<br>
